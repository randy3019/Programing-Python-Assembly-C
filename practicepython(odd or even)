##Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
#Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

num = int(input("enter a number: "))
num2 = num % 2

if num2 > 0:
    print("result is an odd number. ")
else:
    print("result is an even number.")
